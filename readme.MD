## Docker Container Volume
- when docker is started, the container can have read-only and read-write access.
- newly inserted data will be stored in a read-write portion.
- It is highly recommended to use overlay2 rather than overlay since overlay2 has more efficient node .utilization

## How to store data permanently 
- $ docker run -d -v /webdata:/var/www/html:ro httpd:latest (Read only).

## How to share data between containers 
- We can create a shared host (think as a mounting point). 
- The host will have a dedicated volume storage that can be shared with other containers.

## How it works? 
- The first conatiner (df) will push the "df -h /" info to the volume's web document (index.html).
- The second container (webserver) will show the contents from the storage and display on the webserver. 
- Think as a very simple Micro Service architecture in a nutshell.

## Instructions
```
## Build Docker files for both containers 
$ docker build -t mn519019/webserver:latest .
$ docker build -t mn519019/df:latest . 

## Check the created images from the build process
$ docker images | grep -i mn519019
mn519019/df          latest    b5d0325cab8c   54 minutes ago   63.1MB < ------
mn519019/httpd       latest    73c10eb9266e   7 days ago       145MB  < ------

## Run containers using -v option 
## The web server should only have a "read-only" option to minimize security breaches
$ docker run -d --name web -p 80:80 -v /webdata:/var/www/html:ro mn519019/httpd
$ docker run -d -v /webdata:/webdata --name df mn519019/df:latest

```
